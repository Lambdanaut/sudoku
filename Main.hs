-- 1) Add the current state to the frontier  *
-- 2) Repeat the following
--     a) Look for the lowest heuristic cost on the frontier. Set it as the current state.
--     b) Switch it to the explored list.
--     c) For every space on the board: 
--         * Ignore it if it is filled in, illegal to fill in, or on the explored list.
--	       * If it isnâ€™t on the frontier, add it to the frontier. 
--           Make the current state the parent of this state. (Add in a backtrack function) 
--           Record the heuristic cost of this state
--     d) Stop when: 
--         * there are no empty spaces on the puzzle
--         * the frontier is empty, in which case the puzzle is unsolvable
--  3) Return the final state
